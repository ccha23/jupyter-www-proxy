# Jupyter www server

A very simple HTTP jupyter proxy server to serve `www` folder of the jupyter notebook directory. Install with pip:

```
pip install jupyter-www-proxy
```

The server can be launched from the JupyterLab launcher window by clicking the `www` icon. In the classic notebook interface, lauch it from the file tab menu item `new->www`. If `www` will be created under the jupyter working directory if it does not already exists.
